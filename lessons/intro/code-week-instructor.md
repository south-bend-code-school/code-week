# Instructor Instructions

## Intro to Web Development
<hr>
## What is HTML?

Discuss the meaning of HTML and explain how HTML is the basic building block for every website.

## CodePen

**Remind students that changes will not be saved if they refresh the Codepen**

Discuss tag pairs, and highlight for students how to click on one tag to see its mate highlighted in Codepen.

## Start Coding

Work through the project yourself before teaching students.

### HTML

After this section, students should have picked a theme for their webpage, and successfully changed all of the text on the site.

### Images

After this section, students should have six (more or less is also fine) images instead of the six cat images.

### CSS

Show students how to minimize and maximize the different code tabs in Codepen. Help them arrange the tabs for maximum efficiency.

### Text Colors

After this section, students should have changed background and text colors.

You could spend a short time discussing color theory and show them the website [color.adobe](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) to help them pick colors that will look good together.

### Maps

After this section students should have embedded a new map in their page.

The most common confusion here is about replacing the entire `<iframe>` tag instead of just the contents.

### Links

After this section, students should have changed the links on their page, and possible added or removed links.

## Extras

### Gradients

In this section, students will experiment with gradients. They will need help with the syntax of creating a gradient.

### JS

Adventurous students may want to dive further into JS here. Challenge them to add another field to the form and add the corresponding JS to make that field active.

**Sample Code:**

_HTML_ <br>
<img style="height: auto; max-width: 75%;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/newformhtml.png">

_JS_ <br>
<img style="height: auto; max-width: 100%;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/newformjs.png">

## Further Extensions

Students can experiment with adding new sections to their webpages by recreating the code that already exists for a section.

Students can experiment with different CSS properties like font-families. Share the link for MDN's CSS intro page [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics).

Basic properties to start with:<br>
<input type="checkbox" class="checkbox"> border <br>
<input type="checkbox" class="checkbox"> background-image <br>
<input type="checkbox" class="checkbox"> font-size <br>
<input type="checkbox" class="checkbox"> font-family <br>
<input type="checkbox" class="checkbox"> font-weight <br>
